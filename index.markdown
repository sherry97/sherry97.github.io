I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.
I am advised by Prof. Stephen Pizer. I received a M.S. in Computer Science from UNC Chapel Hill in 2022 and a B.S. in Computer Science from Caltech in 2020.

My research interests are the intersection of medical image analysis, machine learning, and computer vision.
